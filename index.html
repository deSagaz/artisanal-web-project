                <h2>Founder of University Colleges</h2>
                <p>Unhappy with the undemanding and large scale climate of university education in the Netherlands, Professor Hans Adriaansens started developing the idea of a small scale and academically intensive undergraduate college in the Netherlands. This resulted in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_College_Utrecht">University College Utrecht</a> in 1998 and in Roosevelt Academy, now known as  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_College_Roosevelt">University College Roosevelt</a>, in 2004.</p>
